<p>
    I am the founder of the <b>Fantastic Four</b>! I have a mastery of mechanical,
        aerospace and electrical engineering, chemistry, all levels of physics, and human and alien biology.
        I one of the top ten most intelligent super heros of all time! I gained the power of elasticity from irradiation
        by cosmic rays.
        I have the ability to convert his entire body into a highly malleable state at will, allowing me to stretch,
        deform, and reform myself into virtually any shape! Some of the villians we have defeated are:
        Mole Man, the Skrulls, Namor the Sub-Mariner, Doctor Doom, the Puppet Master, Blastaar, the Frightful Four,
        Annihilus, Galactus, Klaw and many more!
