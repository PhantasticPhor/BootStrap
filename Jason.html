<p>
    I am the founder of the <b>Fantastic Four</b>! I have a mastery of mechanical,
        aerospace and electrical engineering, chemistry, all levels of physics, and human and alien biology.
        I one of the top ten most intelligent super heros of all time! I gained the power of elasticity from irradiation
        by cosmic rays.
        I have the ability to convert his entire body into a highly malleable state at will, allowing me to stretch,
        deform, and reform myself into virtually any shape! Some of the villians we have defeated are:
        Mole Man, the Skrulls, Namor the Sub-Mariner, Doctor Doom, the Puppet Master, Blastaar, the Frightful Four,
        Annihilus, Galactus, Klaw and many more!

    <h1>About Mister Fantiastic </h1>
</div>
<p>I was born in Central City, California, I am the son of Evelyn and Nathaniel Richards. My dad
    was a scientific genius, and I inherited a similar level of intellect and interests. I was what you could call a
    child prodigy. With a special aptitude in mathematics, physics, and mechanics, Reed Richards was taking
    college-level courses when he was 14. <br>
    I attended several prestigious universities such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, California Institute
    of Technology, Harvard University, Columbia University, and Empire State University. By the age of 20, I had
    several degrees in the sciences under my belt. <br>
    Moving on to Harvard, I earned Ph.D.s in Physics and Electrical Engineering while working as a military
    scientist, all this by the age of 22. I also worked in communications for the Army. Three years later, in his
    mid-20s, Reed used his inheritance, along with government funding, to finance my research.
    Then one fateful mission which had myself, Susan Storm, Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm. When our ship passed through
    the Van Allen belt a radiation belt. Which hit us with a cosmic radiation. That would give us all the powers
    that we have today and make us <em>The Fantastic Four!
